Search Unicode characters.


USAGE:

  unicode-names [-r|--range RANGE] [PATTERN...]

  PATTERN is one or more strings to be matched against the character name.

  RANGE is matched against the numeric value of the character. It can be
  either <start>-<end>, or <start>+<offset>. <start> and <end> are expected
  as hexadecimal values, and <offset> as decimal.


EXAMPLES:

  $ unicode-names arrowhead left

    Characters with both "arrowhead" and "left" in the name.

  $ unicode-names -r 2200-2220
  $ unicode-names -r 2200+32

    In both cases, characters between U+2200 and U+2220.
